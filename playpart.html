        MRS. ELVSTED.

[Turns and whispers eagerly.] Well--has any one come?


BERTA.

[Softly.] Yes, a girl has just brought this letter.


MRS. ELVSTED.

[Quickly, holding out her hand.] A letter! Give it to me!


BERTA.

No, it's for Dr. Tesman, ma'am.


MRS. ELVSTED.

Oh, indeed.


BERTA.

It was Miss Tesman's servant that brought it. I'll lay it here on the
table.


MRS. ELVSTED.

Yes, do.
